# serverless-prodigit
University project for the Cloud Computing course.

Serverless Prodigit is a solution to the problem of booking a seat for a lecture at University, especially for those institutes that have a high number of students.
It is developed using the AWS infrastructure, and in particular some serverless services, in order to solve all the possible availability problems.

Serverless Prodigit lets students book/unbook a seat, and it also provides all the features needed by the teachers for the lectures' administration.
Every detail is provided in the pdf reprort.
